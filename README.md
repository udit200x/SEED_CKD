Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project predicts Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using patient data and machine learning models. The application is built using Streamlit and provides a simple and interactive interface for healthcare professionals to input patient information and receive predictions. The website is hosted on Render for easy accessibility.

Features
User Authentication: Secure login system to protect patient data.
Patient Data Input: Intuitive forms for entering relevant medical information.
CKD Prediction: Leverages a trained machine learning model for accurate predictions.
Results Display: Clear and easy-to-understand output of prediction results.
Web Hosting: Hosted on Render for seamless access.
